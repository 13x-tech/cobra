Cobra is both a library for creating powerful modern CLI applications as well as a program to generate applications and command files.

Cobra is used in many Go projects such as [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/),
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io), and [Github CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli) to
name a few. [This list](./projects_using_cobra.md) contains a more extensive list of projects using Cobra.


# Overview

Cobra is a library providing a simple interface to create powerful modern CLI
interfaces similar to git & go tools.

# ATTENTION

!!!WARNING!!!

I have ripped apart this library to remove viper and the cli which is not needed by me. Please do not use this.
